# Orientation Lock & Device Rotation Feature

## Overview
The app now locks to portrait orientation and automatically triggers the comic rotation feature when the device is rotated to landscape.

## Changes Made

### 1. Manifest Update (`manifest.webmanifest`)
```json
"orientation": "portrait"  // Changed from "any" to "portrait"
```
- **Purpose**: Prevents the entire app from rotating
- **Effect**: App UI stays in portrait mode regardless of device orientation

### 2. Smart Orientation Handler (`app.js`)
Enhanced the `orientationchange` event listener with intelligent behavior:

#### When in Fullscreen/Rotated Comic Mode:
- Repositions the rotated comic and toolbar
- Ensures optimal viewing in the rotated view

#### When in Normal Mode (NOT rotated):
- Detects when device rotates to landscape
- Automatically triggers `Rotate()` function to enter comic fullscreen mode
- Only activates if comic is not already rotated

```javascript
window.addEventListener('orientationchange', function() {
  const rotatedComic = document.getElementById('rotated-comic');
  if (rotatedComic) {
    // Handle repositioning in fullscreen mode
    setTimeout(() => {
      maximizeRotatedImage(rotatedComic);
      positionFullscreenToolbar();
    }, 300);
  } else {
    // Trigger comic rotation when device goes to landscape
    setTimeout(() => {
      const orientation = screen.orientation?.type || window.orientation;
      const isLandscape = orientation === 'landscape-primary' || 
                          orientation === 'landscape-secondary' || 
                          Math.abs(window.orientation) === 90;
      
      if (isLandscape) {
        const comic = document.getElementById('comic');
        if (comic && !comic.className.includes('rotate')) {
          Rotate(); // Trigger comic rotation
        }
      }
    }, 300);
  }
});
```

## User Experience

### Before:
- Entire app would rotate when device rotated
- UI elements would reflow and potentially cause layout issues
- User had to manually tap comic to rotate

### After:
- App stays in portrait orientation (stable UI)
- Device rotation to landscape **automatically** enters comic fullscreen mode
- Provides intuitive, natural interaction pattern
- Users can still manually tap comic to rotate (preserves existing functionality)

## Technical Details

### Orientation Detection:
- Uses modern `screen.orientation.type` API (primary)
- Falls back to legacy `window.orientation` API (compatibility)
- Detects both `landscape-primary` and `landscape-secondary`
- Legacy support: `Math.abs(window.orientation) === 90`

### Timing:
- 300ms delay after orientation change
- Ensures device has completed orientation transition
- Prevents race conditions with browser rendering

### State Management:
- Checks for existing rotated comic to prevent conflicts
- Validates comic element exists before triggering
- Only rotates if comic is in normal (non-rotated) state

## Browser Support

### Modern Browsers (Recommended):
- Chrome/Edge 38+
- Firefox 43+
- Safari 13+
- Opera 25+

### Legacy Support:
- Falls back to `window.orientation` for older mobile browsers
- Gracefully degrades - manual rotation still works everywhere

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Natural interaction - rotate device to see comic larger
2. **Stable UI**: App interface doesn't rotate, preventing layout shifts
3. **Intuitive**: Follows user expectations from media viewing apps
4. **Dual Mode**: Works with both device rotation AND manual tap
5. **PWA Compliant**: Proper manifest configuration for standalone mode

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Device rotation to landscape triggers comic rotation
- [ ] Device rotation back to portrait exits fullscreen
- [ ] Manual tap rotation still works
- [ ] Works in both PWA installed mode and browser
- [ ] Toolbar remains accessible in rotated view
- [ ] No conflicts between device rotation and manual rotation
- [ ] Settings panel behaves correctly during rotations

## Notes

- The 300ms delay is intentional to allow orientation change to complete
- Comic rotation can still be triggered manually by tapping the comic
- The app manifest orientation setting applies to PWA installed mode
- Browser mode may have different orientation behaviors depending on browser
