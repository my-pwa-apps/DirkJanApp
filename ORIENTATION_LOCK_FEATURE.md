# Orientation Lock Feature

## Overview
The app now locks to portrait orientation, preventing the entire UI from rotating when the device is tilted. This provides a stable, consistent interface while users can still manually rotate comics for better viewing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Manifest Update (`manifest.webmanifest`)
```json
"orientation": "portrait"  // Changed from "any" to "portrait"
```
- **Purpose**: Prevents the entire app from rotating
- **Effect**: App UI stays in portrait mode regardless of device orientation
- **Benefit**: Stable interface, no layout shifts or UI disruption

### 2. Orientation Handler (`app.js`)
Enhanced the `orientationchange` event listener for fullscreen comic mode:

#### When in Fullscreen/Rotated Comic Mode:
- Repositions the rotated comic and toolbar when device orientation changes
- Ensures optimal viewing in the fullscreen rotated view
- Adapts to both landscape and portrait device orientations

```javascript
window.addEventListener('orientationchange', function() {
  const rotatedComic = document.getElementById('rotated-comic');
  if (rotatedComic) {
    // Handle repositioning in fullscreen mode
    setTimeout(() => {
      maximizeRotatedImage(rotatedComic);
      positionFullscreenToolbar();
    }, 300);
  }
});
```

## User Experience

### Before:
- Entire app would rotate when device rotated
- UI elements would reflow causing layout issues
- Navigation became confusing in landscape mode
- Buttons and controls would shift positions

### After:
- App stays locked in portrait orientation (stable UI)
- Device rotation doesn't affect main interface
- User manually taps comic to enter fullscreen rotated view
- In fullscreen mode, device rotation adjusts the comic positioning optimally
- Predictable, stable interface at all times

## Technical Details

### Orientation Detection in Fullscreen:
- Listens for `orientationchange` events
- Only repositions when in fullscreen/rotated comic mode
- 300ms delay ensures device completes orientation transition
- Prevents race conditions with browser rendering

### Comic Rotation:
- Manual tap/click on comic enters fullscreen mode
- Comic rotates 90 degrees using CSS transform
- Fullscreen toolbar remains accessible
- Swipe gestures work in fullscreen mode
- Click anywhere to exit fullscreen

## Browser Support

### Modern Browsers:
- Chrome/Edge 38+
- Firefox 43+
- Safari 13+
- Opera 25+

### PWA Mode:
- Orientation lock applies when installed as PWA
- Browser mode may vary based on browser settings

## Benefits

1. **Stable UI**: App interface never rotates, preventing layout shifts
2. **Predictable Navigation**: Buttons and controls stay in same position
3. **Better UX**: No jarring transitions when device tilts
4. **Manual Control**: User decides when to view comic in fullscreen/rotated mode
5. **PWA Compliant**: Proper manifest configuration for standalone mode
6. **Performance**: No unnecessary reflows or repaints from orientation changes

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] App stays in portrait when device rotates
- [ ] Manual tap on comic enters fullscreen rotated mode
- [ ] In fullscreen, device rotation repositions comic optimally
- [ ] Toolbar remains accessible in fullscreen
- [ ] Can exit fullscreen by tapping comic or overlay
- [ ] Works in both PWA installed mode and browser
- [ ] Settings panel not affected by orientation lock
- [ ] Navigation buttons stay in consistent positions

## Notes

- The orientation lock applies primarily in PWA installed mode
- Browser mode behavior depends on browser implementation
- Manual comic rotation (tap to rotate) still works as before
- The 300ms delay in fullscreen repositioning is intentional
- Orientation lock provides a more app-like, stable experience
